            <p class="whyplay">No matter if your child is a novice or is absolutely filthy on the field they will continue to learn to appreciate the sport, for it is bountiful in all sorts of awesome feelings and personality shaping experiences. May it be the comradery you feel as a team, the explosion of emotions upon successfully blocking an attacker or scoring a goal, or learning humility after an unfortunate match, having the experience of playing soccer, we think, is an essential experience for all people</p>
